\frametitle{Thrombolysis}
Thrombolysis aims to break down a clot by activating the body's own clot breakdown mechanisms.

\vspace{5mm}

Thrombolysis is given as an injection followed by an infusion (\emph{drip}).

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{5mm}
    \item Expert clinical opinion is that one in five people (20\%) should be receiving thrombolysis.
    \item In England, about 1 in 9 people (11\%) actually receive thrombolysis.
    \item Nearly half the people who \emph{could} benefit from thrombolysis do not currently have the opportunity.
    \item Use of thrombolysis in England has been stable for 10 years.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}

\end{center}
We can model key changes to pathway:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What if the pathway were faster?
    \item What if hospital determined the stroke onset time in more patients?
    \item What if clinical decision-making was like that of \emph{benchmark} hospitals? (Predict what treatment a patient would receive at other hospitals).
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Machine learning overview}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth]{./images/ml_model_high_level}
\end{center}

Machine learning (and nearly all \emph{artificial intelligence}) is based on the simple principle of recognising similarity to what has been seen before.
\vspace{3mm}

We accessed 240,000 emergency stroke admissions in England and Wales over three years. That is a lot of examples to learn from!

\frametitle{SAMueL-1 Summary: What did we test?}

We used clinical pathway simulation and machine learning to analyse a series of \emph{what if?} questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{3mm}
    \item What if arrival-to-treatment time was 30 minutes?
    \item what if all hospitals determined stroke onset time as frequently as an \emph{upper quartile} hospital (a hospital ranked 25 out of 100, for determining stroke onset time).
    \item What if decisions to thrombolyse were made according to a majority vote of 30 benchmark hospitals?
\end{itemize}

For each hospital we use their own patients to ask these questions, to allow for differences in local patient populations.

\frametitle{What questions are we asking in SAMueL-2?}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{5mm}
    \item What patients do clinicians agree and disagree on, when considering when they should receive thrombolysis?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item We'll discuss that at our next meeting!
    \end{itemize}
    \item How do \emph{organisational factors} (such as use of specialist stroke nurses) affect the thrombolysis pathway and decision-making?

    \item How best can we engage clinicians in our work, and prompt them to reconsider their emergency stroke pathway and/or decision-making?
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communication of general findings.
        \item Web application for individual hospitals.
        \item A 'hospital profile` for each hospital.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
